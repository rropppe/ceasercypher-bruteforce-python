# Caeser cipher and brute force program

***PYTHON***

## Caesar cipher

### Encrypt

To use this program you must:
* enter the message you want to encrypt;
* enter a shift in a NUMERIC value (necessarily an integer);
* get an answer

### Decrypt

To use this program you must:
* enter the message you want to deencrypt;
* enter a shift in a NUMERIC value (necessarily an integer);
* get an answer

## Brute force 

The program iterates through the message received using the Caesar cipher and displays all options (the number is limited by the number of letters of the alphabet). All you have to do is choose the right one.


To use the program you must:
* replace a and b if you do not have the Russian alphabet (a = a-z; b = z-y);
* change the input to your encrypted message;
* change the range;
* get the result

# **All programs are written in the Russian alphabet, but decrypt and encrypt work with English**
